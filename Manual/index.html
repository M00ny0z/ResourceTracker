resources that do not belong to a specific category.</p>
<p>You can click on a category to view resources that belong to said category. If you no longer wish to
see the resources under said category, simply click it again. You can select multiple categories
all at once which will show resources that belong to any one of the selected categories.</p>
<p>You can also use the search bar to search for resources that contain in the name or in the Description
what you have typed in.</p>
